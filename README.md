# Storm Data Analysis

## Synopsis

The dataset for storm events in the United States is compiled from gathering data entered by many different people, so it suffers a little bit of inconsistent results. It is, however, possible to clean the dataset to some extent. In order for it to be manageable, and because we are only interested in the most harmful events, I have excluded from the analysis any event whose economical or health consequence falls below the median for the category (see below).

The analysis was aimed at answering two questions, namely: - Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health? - Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
